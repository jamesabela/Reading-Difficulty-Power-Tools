# Reading-Difficulty-Power-Tools
This is a GScript to help teachers simplify their vocabulary and plan lessons. This mostly aimed at SEN &amp; EAL students, but could be useful for all lessons.  The tool website is at: https://sites.google.com/view/rdpt/
Thank you to Hampton Lintorn Catlin and his team of volunteers who made https://github.com/wordset/wordset-dictionary and have made it possible to use a real dictionary in this project.
