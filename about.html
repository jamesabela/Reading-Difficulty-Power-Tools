    <p>RDPT adds tools to help teachers quickly analyse any
      document for difficult words and then either simplify these words or teach
      them. </p>
      
      <p>Check for updates at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rdpt/updates" target="_blank">RDPT updates page</a>.</p>

      convenient side tab where you can look up the meaning, thesaurus and
      images from the noun project. </p>  </details>    
<details>
<summary>Doc Low Freq Words</summary>
      
    <p>This shows all the low frequency words from your document in the sidebar.</p></details>   
<details>
<summary>‚ó´ Add Low frequency Word Table</summary>

<summary>üîçDifficulty Guide</summary>
    <p>The difficulty guide gives you an analysis of your document including:</p>   
 <strong>Flesch Score</strong>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests"target="_blank">Flesch score</a> is a score based on the syllables in a
      word and the length of sentences.&nbsp; Complex sentences with complex
      words are much harder to read.&nbsp; It will tell you if this is <span style="color: #009900;">Good</span>,
      <span style="color: #ff6600;">Challenging</span> or <span style="color: red;">Difficult.
        </span>It will also let you know if a document has Long sentences.
      (Anything above 25 words per sentence. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#how-people-read"

        target="_blank">UK Government</a> has a great doc explaining this.)</p>
    <p>You can open the triangle to see more details.&nbsp; You know you want to
      see those <i>hidden</i> stats! </p>   
      
    <strong>Vocabulary Difficulty</strong><br>
    <p>These tools will check the vocabulary in your document and show you where
      your words lie on this scale. More details at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rdpt/research" target="_blank">RDPT research page.</a></p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Difficult Words (Low frequency)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </strong></p>
    <p>These are words that only proficient users would be expected to
      understand unless they have been directly taught them. </p>
    <p></p>
    <strong>Reading Time</strong><br>
    <p>These times are based on the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/xynwg/" target="_blank">meta
        analysis</a> that Marc Brysbaert did. Reading analyses are based on wpm
      (a word is 5 characters), the average grade 4 child will read at 150 wpm
      (2.5 words per second) if they are familiar with the vocabulary. (A young
      adult will read at 180wpm)</p></details>
      
      
<details>
<summary>High Frequency Word List</summary>
    <p>You can see the word lists being used.&nbsp; These are based
      on the research that I did for Taylor's University and then completely
      forgot about! They've been given an update for 2020 and are now in the
      app.</p></details>

<details>

    highlighting.</p></details>
