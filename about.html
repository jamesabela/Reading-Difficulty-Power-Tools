    <strong> </strong>
    <p>The Document Wordlist organises all of the words in your document into a
      convenient side tab where you can look up the meaning, thesaurus and
      images from the noun project. </p>      
    <h2><strong>Doc Low Freq Words <br>

    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests"

        target="_blank">Flesch score</a> is a score based on the syllables in a
      word and the length of sentences.&nbsp; Complex sentences with complex
      words are much harder to read.&nbsp; It will tell you if this is <span style="color: #009900;">Good</span>,
      <span style="color: #ff6600;">Challenging</span> or <span style="color: red;">Difficult.
        </span>It will also let you know if a document has Long sentences.
      (Anything above 25 words per sentence. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#how-people-read"

        target="_blank">UK Government</a> has a great doc explaining this.)</p>

    <strong>Vocabulary Difficulty</strong><br>
    <p>These tools will check the vocabulary in your document and show you where
      your words lie on this scale. The <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages"

      <strong>Difficult Words (Low frequency)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

    <p></p>
    <strong>Reading Time</strong><br>
    <p>These times are based on the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/xynwg/" target="_blank">meta
        analysis</a> that Marc Brysbaert did. Reading analyses are based on wpm
      (a word is 5 characters), the average grade 4 child will read at 150 wpm
      (2.5 words per second) if they are familiar with the vocabulary. (A young
      adult will read at 180wpm)</p>
    <h2>High Frequency Word List</h2>
    <p>You can see the word lists being used.&nbsp; These are based
      on the research that I did for Taylor's University and then completely
      forgot about! They've been given an update for 2020 and are now in the
      app.</p>
    <h2>‚ñ¶Create Sheet</h2>
    <p>You can create a Google Sheet either all of the words in your doc or the
      low frequency words.Please note that this might take a few minutes to generate.</p>
    <h2>Highlighting</h2>
    <p>You can highlight low frequency words in place and then remove the
      highlighting.</p>
